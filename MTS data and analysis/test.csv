0,GENHX,"The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.","Doctor: Good afternoon, sir. Did you just have a birthday? I don't have my chart with me right now, the nurse is bringing it. 
Patient: Good afternoon, sir. Yes, I just turned fifty five. 
Doctor: You identify as African American, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's right. 
Doctor: When was your last visit, sir? 
Patient: Um, it was on July twenty ninth two thousand eight. 
Doctor: Yes, I see. Did we go over your M R I results? 
Patient: No, I was having those new seizures, remember?
Doctor: Yes, I do. Well, the M R I demonstrated right contrast temporal mass. 
Patient: What exactly does that mean, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, given this mass, and your new seizures, I am concerned that this could be a high grade glioma, we'll need to do more tests."

Doctor: Seventy seven. 
Guest_clinician: She was sedated with Ativan, correct? 
Doctor: Yeah, we had to sedate her. She wasn't doing so well upon arrival and appeared short of breath. She couldn't give us a history and we immediately had Xray come in to scan her lungs.

3,GENHX,"The patient presents today for followup, recently noted for E. coli urinary tract infection.  She was treated with Macrobid for 7 days, and only took one nighttime prophylaxis.

Previous urine cultures have shown E. coli, November 2007, May 7, 2008 and July 7, 2008.","Doctor: Has your E coli improved since your last visit, ma'am?
Patient: Yes, but I had some complications with the medicine.
Doctor: You were taking the Macrobid, correct?
Patient: Yes, I took it once a day at night for about seven days. 
Doctor: What complications did you have?

Patient: Yes, that sounds familiar."
4,GENHX,"The patient is a 49-year-old white female, established patient to Dermatology, last seen in the office on 08/10/2004.  She comes in today for reevaluation of her acne plus she has had what she calls a rash for the past two months now on her chest, stomach, neck, and back.  On examination, this is a flaring of her acne with small folliculitis lesions.  The patient has been taking amoxicillin 500 mg b.i.d. and using Tazorac cream 0.1, and her face is doing well, but she has been out of her medicine now for three days also.  She has also been getting photofacials at Healing Waters and was wondering about what we could offer as far as cosmetic procedures and skin care products, etc.  The patient is married.  She is a secretary.","Doctor: Nice to see you again, miss. I see your last visit was back on August tenth two thousand and four. How are you?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Nice to see you again as well. I've been doing fine. 
Doctor: How is your husband doing? 
Patient: He's doing fine. Just working a lot. 
Doctor: Great! I hope the work isn't getting him too stressed out. Also, I need to fill out the ethnicity section in your paperwork; it seems to be missing. What ethnicity do you identify as?
Patient: Oh, yes. I am white. 
Doctor: Thanks! Are you still working too? 
Patient: Yeah, I am. My secretary position has been super stressful lately. 
Doctor: I understand. How is your acne doing? 
Patient: I think it's been getting better, but I've had this rash for the last two months on my chest, stomach, neck, and back. 
Doctor: I see. Let me take a look at this rash. I see you have these small folliculitis lesions that are pus filled bumps centered on your hair. 
Patient: Oh, no. Is that bad? 
Doctor: It's treatable. It seems like it's happening because your acne is flaring up. 
Patient: Oh, really. Is it because I stopped my medication for the last three days? 
Doctor: I forgot what I prescribed you. Let me take a look at my notes. Oh, I see. I prescribed you five hundred milligrams of Amoxicillin to take twice a day and a point one Tazorac cream. Have those been working? 
Patient: Yeah, they have. I noticed my face started to get better. 
Doctor: Continue to take those and try not to stop it. Have you been trying anything else? 
Patient: I actually started going to Healing Waters to get photofacials. 
Doctor: I see. Has that been helpful? 
Patient: Yeah, it has, but I want a faster treatment. I'm only forty nine and want to look younger. Are there any procedures or skin care products that can be used to help my face look better?"
5,GENHX,"The patient is a 68-year-old man who returns for recheck.  He has a history of ischemic cardiac disease, he did see Dr. XYZ in February 2004 and had a thallium treadmill test.  He did walk for 8 minutes.  The scan showed some mild inferior wall scar and ejection fraction was well preserved.  He has not had difficulty with chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, nocturnal dyspnea, or edema.","Doctor: Hello, sir. Welcome back. Looks like we are going to revaluate your heart issues. You have a history of ischemic cardiac disease, correct? Can you also state your age?
Patient: Sixty eight. Yes. I saw doctor X Y Z in February two thousand four and he made me walk on a treadmill for eight minutes. Do you have the results from that?
Doctor: I do. The scan showed some wall scarring but also that the amount of blood leaving your heart per contraction was normal. Do you experience any chest pain, palpitations, difficulty sleeping at night, leg or arm swelling, or shortness of breath while lying flat?
Patient: I do not have any issues like that."
6,GENHX,"The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias.","Doctor: Hi there! I am Doctor Jones, sir. 
Patient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. 
Doctor: What brings you into see me today? 
Patient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.
Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?
Patient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. 
Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? 
Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  
Doctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. 
Doctor: How long has that been going on? 
Patient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  
Doctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? 
Patient: No. I don't think so. 
Doctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? 
Patient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. 
Doctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?
Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? 
Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.
Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. 
Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? 
Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  
Doctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? 
Patient: Yes, he did. 
Doctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? 
Patient: Yes, I just started Zetia.
Doctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? 
Patient: No.
Doctor: Can you remind me how old you are?
Patient: I am fifty-five."

Doctor: Thank you. I just needed to make sure my chart was correct. So, is this left knee still bothering you? 
Patient: Yes, unfortunately, it still is.
Doctor: You've had three Synvisc injections, correct? When was your last one?
Patient: Yes, that was about five days ago, right before my birthday. 
Doctor: Did that provide any relief at all?  
Patient: Well, I'd say there's been, um, thirty-five or forty percent improvement. 
Doctor: Are you still having the pinching pain?
Patient: Yes, it's so bad when I try to put my full weight onto this knee. 
Doctor: Can you bend this knee at all?
Patient: Ow, no, please stop. I can't handle that bending, doctor. 
Doctor: Can you straighten the knee out for me, please? 
Patient: No, not all the way, look. 
Doctor: Yes, that's not out all the way. 
Patient: It hurts really bad, doctor. 
Doctor: With ten being the worst pain ever, how would you rate your pain today out of ten?
Patient: Oh, it's easily a ten out of ten. 
Doctor: Have you used ice or heat? 
Patient: Yes, I use both. I alternate the two. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking?
Patient: I'm using that Tylenol with codeine you gave me and then some ibuprofen I got from the grocery store. 
Doctor: Have those helped at all?
Patient: I'd say they helped pretty minimally."

She has a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis.  She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines. The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.  She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily.  She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms.  She is using a cane to help her ambulate.","Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. You're here for a follow up, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. Guess what, I just had my seventy seventh birthday. 
Doctor: Happy birthday!
Patient: Thank you, doctor. 
Doctor:  Just to confirm, ma'am, you identify as White, correct? 
Patient: Thank you. Yes, doctor. That's correct.

Patient: Yes, that's right. I saw him for low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and symptomatic right L two radiculopathy.
Doctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Have you ever had surgery on your back? 
Patient: Yes, I had spinal stenosis, so they did, um, a laminectomy. 
Doctor: How did you respond to the procedure? 
Patient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? 
Patient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. 
Doctor: Do you remember which side it was in?
Patient: It was in the right side, L2-L3.
Doctor: When was the last time you had these injections into the lower back?
Patient: The last one was in March of two thousand five. 
Doctor: How did your symptoms progress following the injections? 
Patient: Well, I went back to Doctor X Y Z, and then he thought that the symptoms I was having were coming from my right hip. 
Doctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? 
Patient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. 
Doctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z.

Doctor: Is that when you had the last injections? 
Patient: Correct. 
Doctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?
Patient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. 
Doctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?
Patient: Yes, it still hurts. 
Doctor: What makes the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. 
Doctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?
Patient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. 
Doctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?
Patient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. 
Doctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? 
Patient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet. Sometimes I take as many as four times a day. 
Doctor: Does this help the pain?
Patient: No, I'm still in pretty significant pain, doctor."
12,GENHX,"The patient has a previous history of a left traumatic wrist injury, which has left him with a chronic scapholunate problem and possibly other problems in his wrist.  However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury.  Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist.  He is here now for evaluation.","Doctor: Hello, sir. How are you doing today? 
Patient: I hurt my left wrist again. 
Doctor: Oh, no. Again? Did you hurt it before?
Patient: Yeah, I did. I've actually hurt it a lot. The most recent one was probably the worst pain of my life. 
Doctor: I see. How did you hurt it? 
Patient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting. 
Doctor: Did it hurt before that? 
Patient: Yeah, it did. It was sore and stuff, but the pain wasn't bothering me too much. I kind of just lived with it. Some days it would be fine, but other days it would hurt a little more. 
Doctor: The recent injury made it worse?
Patient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. 
Doctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? 
Patient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. 
Doctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. 
Patient: My scapho- what? 
Doctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist. I'll see what we can do to get your wrist feeling better."

The pain is located laterally as well as anteriorly into the groin.

Patient: Yeah, it's been getting worse since it started. 
Doctor: Can you show me where the pain is?

14,GENHX,"This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.","Doctor: Hello there, how are you doing? 
Patient: I'm doing good. Thank you. How about you? 
Doctor: Yeah, same old, same old. 
Doctor: So, looks like we're here to discuss your diet. Is that right? 
Patient: Yep. That's right. 
Doctor: Okay, let me look through your chart. It looks like you have high lipid levels, high blood pressure and a possibility for a metabolic syndrome. 
Patient: That looks like my chart. I'm kind of struggling here and I need your help. 
Doctor: Yeah, tell me did you follow the meal plan that we gave to you? 
Patient: I tried for many weeks to follow that meal plan that you gave me. 
Doctor: Okay, did it help? 
Patient: I don't know. I felt like I was still gaining weight instead of losing it. 
Doctor: Did you follow it exactly as you are, as you were asked to do?
Patient: I tried my best. But I feel like I am not doing it correctly or something. 
Doctor: Okay, tell me what kind of activities are you doing? How much physical activity are you doing on a regular basis? 
Patient: I try to walk around one and a half to two miles like every other day, but I'm spending more time in my garden and doing the yard work by myself. 
Doctor: That's good. Gardening gets-- can get hard and it helps you keep active. 
Patient: Oh yes, picking up all those pots from here to there and knowing that backyard of mine, it's a hard job. 
Doctor: Tell me what brings you here today? Like how can I help you? 
Patient: So, I think the meal plan that you gave was not working for me and there was definitely some weight gain, so I went back to my old South Beach Diet. 
Doctor: Okay. What were the results with your South Beach Diet then? Was it effective? 
Patient: I was able to get some pounds off. I felt pretty good about it. 
Doctor: That's good. Then what's the issue? 
Patient: Well, you see, deep in my heart I know this South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for me and that's why I'm back to you. 
Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. You don't know how happy you made me by saying that. 
Patient: Yeah. You know, I'm here. So, tell me what to do to lose all this extra weight and how to enforce a low fat diet? What are your recommendations for that? 
Doctor: Let's set a plan for you."
15,GENHX,"The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago. On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.","Doctor: How old are you? 
Patient: Fifty six. 
Doctor: Are you right handed or left handed? 
Patient: I'm right handed.
Doctor: So, you have this long standing on and off lower back pain on your right side. And it all happened after your motor vehicle accident in September of two thousand and five. 
Patient: That's right. Right after accident. At that time, I did not feel anything, but five days later I started getting this abnormal like pain in the lower side of my back, especially on the right side. It kind of like moved from there to my buttocks on the posterior side on my thigh and on outside of my calf. 
Doctor: Does anything elevate your pain or decreases it? 
Patient: It gets worse when I'm sitting for a longer period, such as like driving or if I'm walking for a long period of time. It is a little less bad when walking, but still, it is there. Lying down relieves the pain for a bit and also standing helps. 
Doctor: Is there any symptom like weakness or pain in your left leg or your right leg? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any change in your bowel movement or your urine function?
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Were your symptoms sudden or were they increasing gradually? 
Patient: They increased slowly. I had the pain killers, Medrol but, it has not been very effective. I also had that big injection in my back. It helped me for a few hours but then next day it was all same for me. 
Doctor: When did this happen? When did you get the injection? 
Patient: This was done four and a half weeks ago. 
Doctor: Okay, let me just quickly check your legs. They look full in strength, and they also seem symmetric to me. Can you raise your leg? Like straight up? 
Patient: Yeah sure. 
Doctor: Yeah, yes. Straight leg raising is also normal."
